      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we worked with Warp to design a home page based on
        their project brief. This was an amazing opportunity to learn about
        designing with a team and complete the iterative design process
        (sketches, low fidelity wireframe, and high fidelity prototypes). We
        also received feedback on our wireframe from both students in our class
        and David, a Senior Product Designer at Warp, in order to improve our
        design.

      <h2>Project Brief</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.warp.dev/">Warp</a>
        is a customizable terminal with collaborative tools and AI integration.
        To summarize the project brief, Warp does not have a centralized home
        page for users to view information about their files, team, usage,
        account and learn more about Warp. Currently, a lot of this information
        is in the settings page, which makes it difficult to find. The home page
        that we designed will serve as an aggregator that ultimately allows for
        increased discovery and usage of Warp’s features.

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        We first created sketches to explore different layouts for the screen
        and modules (components on the screen). Each person drew a minimum of
        eight different screens. Our project was slightly different from the
        other groups because the home was an aggregator, rather than a feature
        with a distinct flow. Therefore, following conversations with our
        professor Vanessa, we agree that it was also important for the sketches
        to depict how the layouts would look based on the user state (new user
        versus active user), instead of focusing on having 8 sets of flows.

      <h2>First Iteration Wireframes</h2>
      <p>These are our first iteration wireframes:</p>

        <div class="group">
          <h4>New User - Personal Page:</h4>

      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        One major design decision we made was regarding the content to display
        on the home page. While we had a list of considerations from the project
        brief, it wasn't feasible to include everything. Drawing inspiration
        from Figma Home, Google Drive and GitHub home, we opted to merge the
        current drive on Warp into our new home pages. This approach enhances
        how intuitive the app is to use and reduces time spent searching for
        desired content. Additionally, we deliberated on how to present metrics,
        live sessions, activity, and Warp content. Centralizing this information
        on a left hand sidebar, we aimed for visual appeal by using profile
        icons for team members, filled bars for metrics, and link icons to
        indicate that clicking on the Warp resources would redirect users.
        Furthermore, we considered what user states to design for. It was
        crucial to cater to both new users (requiring more instructional
        guidance) and active users (with their current content readily
        accessible).
      </p>
      <h3>Inspiration From Sketches</h3>
      <p>
        We noticed that many of us organized content using sidebars and a
        topbar. Therefore, we opted to create a left-sidebar (which we noticed
        was an industry standard compared to a right-sidebar) and added a
        welcoming header for a personal touch. We selected the most-commonly
        found modules from our sketches to include in the left sidebar. We also
        wanted the homepage to be customizable after noticing this trend amongst
        the sketches. Thus, we allow users to hide individual modules and the
        left sidebar if desired. Moreover, many of us had separate team and
        individual pages, so we discussed how a user could navigate between
        these, ultimately deciding upon a toggle. Finally, we found that
        visualizing the items (workflows, sessions and notebooks) as boxes,
        rather than in a list, made the interface feel less
        crowded/overwhelming.
      </p>
      <h3>Intended Impact</h3>
      <p>
        Our main goal with the home page was to create a user-friendly,
        glanceable interface that allows users to understand their current state
        and easily access their content. We achieved this through a split
        layout: the left sidebar displays metrics, live sessions, activities,
        and resources, while the main section shows folders, files, and
        sessions. Additionally, since Warp is designed for collaboration, it was
        important for users to seamlessly switch between personal and team
        views, which organizes their content while still keeping team
        information accessible. Ultimately, our design aligns with the
        priorities outlined in our project brief and enhances the discovery of
        Warp’s features by moving key functionalities from the settings page to
        the home page.

    <div id="wireframe-feedback" class="section">
      <h2>Feedback on Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        We created a five minute presentation of our wireframe using Loom (it is
        addressed to David), which you can watch
        <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/a0beb12a6ac64cef95345878e9811e76"

        Below is some feedback that we received about our first iteration
        wireframe. It is color-coded based on who gave the feedback: red =
        David, blue = Vanessa, green = class.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li class="david">
          If a user is on multiple teams, then a UI may not be the best design
          choice. (David also clarified that while Warp currently only allows a
          user to be on one team, in the future, a user will be able to join
          multiple teams.)
        </li>
        <li class="david">
          It is unclear how to get from the current view to the terminal and how
          to get from the terminal to this view.
        </li>
        <li class="david">
          It is unclear where the black arrow on the top left of the screen goes
          back to.
        </li>
        <li class="david">
          The wireframe currently does not show how to manage (invite and
          remove) members in the team as well as change permissions, which is
          important for the team page.
        </li>
        <li class="david">
          It is unclear where an object would be added if a user clicked the
          plus sign.
        </li>
        <li class="vanessa">
          You should ensure that the order of modules on the left navigation bar
          is based on what is most important to the user.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          The layout feels similar to Google Drive or Finder, which will make it
          intuitive for users to navigate.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          Having too many items in recents may defeat the point of an
          aggregator. In addition, people typically do not interact with a side
          scroll, so it may be unnecessary.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          It would be beneficial to show what happens when you open a folder.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          Rather than displaying all the items, folders and sessions on the
          home, you can only show a few and then have a “view more” button that
          opens another page.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          People may want to have more control over how they see the items in
          their drive. For instance, you could have an option to toggle between
          list and gallery mode, filters and sorting.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div id="wireframe-two" class="section">
      <h2>Second Iteration Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        These are our second iteration wireframes, which were revised based on
        the feedback that we recieved:
      </p>
      <p>(include images of second iteration wireframes)</p>
      <p>
        We felt that having four screens was too few to show user interaction
        with the various components, so we created more screens in our second
        iteration. We removed the metrics from the left sidebar since metrics
        was last on our priorities list, and it did not feel necessary for users
        to constantly see this information (better in the account page).
        Moreover, we received a lot of feedback about making the drive more
        customizable and realized that we were missing basic features, like
        trash and a search bar. Therefore, in addition to including these
        features, we added sorting, filters, and two modes for viewing. We also
        decided not to extend the recent items beyond the page because having
        both horizontal and vertical scrolling, especially when the user has
        many items in their drive, could be confusing. Additionally, we changed
        the toggle (navigating between “Personal” and “Team”) to a drop-down
        since David clarified that in the future Warp would allow users to be on
        multiple teams. Finally, we wanted to make it easy to navigate between
        the home page and terminal. We opted to use the same top bar as the Warp
        app, but added a new tab for the home page, replacing the drive tab
        since the drive is integrated into the home.
      </p>
      <p>
        We incorporated most of the feedback in our second iteration, except we
        didn't find it necessary to restrict the drive content on the home
        screen. Our decision was based on the concern that limiting content
        would increase the number of clicks needed for users to access what they
        want. Furthermore, users can organize their items into folders if they
        feel they have too many.
