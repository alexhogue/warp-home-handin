      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        For this project, we worked with Warp to design a home screen based on a
        breif. We got the opportunity to learn about designing with a team and
        complete the iterative design process. We also seeked feedback about our
        wireframe during this process from both the class and David, a Senior
        Product Designer at Warp, in order to improve.

      <h2>Sketches</h2>
      <p>
        Below are sketches that we created to explore the design of the modules!
        Since the home page is an aggregator, rather than creating a traditional
        flow for a feature, we wanted to show how this page looks in different
        user states (new user vs seasoned user). Therefore, our sketches are a
        combination of flows and different user states.

            src="./assets/lo-fi-1-left-hidden.jpg"
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
      <p>
        We wanted to have both a team page and personal page in order to
        seperate the drive content, but we felt that having a left bar would be
        beneficial to put glancable information. Based on the project brief, our
        order of priority was: information about my files, information about my
        team, learning more about Warp, managing my account, and view usage
        metrics. Therefore, the drive portion took up a majority of the screen,
        but the left bar also included information about the activity, current
        live sessions and Warp resources.
      </p>
      <h3>Inspiration From Sketches</h3>
      <p>
        We noticed that many of the sketches explored placing content at both
        the center and sides of the screens. Quite a few of us had left side
        bars with information and the items about files were placed at the
        center of the screen, so we kept that in the wireframe. In addition,
        since people showed flows navigating to a team screen we thought making
        them both accessible from the home page would be easier. We also liked
        the idea of having users be able to toggle the information on the left
        and even hide it if they did not want to constant see it.

        Below we have included some of the feedback that we recieved on the
        first iteration wireframe where red is for David (Warp Product
        Designer), blue is for Vanessa (Professor) and green is for the class.

          If a user is on multiple teams than a UI may not be the best design
          choice.

          terminal to this view.

          People like that the design/model feels similar to Google Drive so
          people will know how to operate it.
        </li>
        <li class="vanessa">
          Ensure that the order of modules on the left is based on what is most
          important to the user.
        </li>
        <li class="class">
          Having too many recents may defeat point of an aggregator. In
          addition, it may be unnecessary to have a side scroll for recents
          since they are not typically interacted with as much.
        </li>
        <li class="class">Show the flow when you open a folder.</li>
        <li class="class">
          People may want more control over how they see the items in their
          drive. For instance, you could have an option to toggle between list
          and gallery mode, filters and sorting.
